I will be making my own OS-ish thing. More like a "simulated desktop environment", but whatever.

To use, click on `tags`, click on `downloads` in the latest release, and download `ususos.zip`. Then extract it, and double-click `ususos.jar` to run it (assuming you have Java installed).
If you don't have Java installed, you will have to install it at https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp or get the JDK at https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/downloads/ (don't install the JDK unless you want to actually program in Java)
